title: New checklist
---
## What's done (since last time):
- Migrated whole project to internal GitLab and improved code organization
- Moved menu entries arount - looks (surprisingly) OK
- Looked into print layout (doable with Tailwind CSS) and search (build-time indexing and search with lunar.js)
- Updated processor logo on homepage
- Pages:
  * Partners & Associations
  * Presentations 
  * Solutions
  * Jobs - with filtering, keeping application by e-mail for now
  * Company structure (90%)

## Questions
- Jobs - Do we want About Tachyum section on each job offer page? (Maybe just in print layout, or on list page since it is the same)
- Menu - Should we move Contact under Company? (non-essential, menus can be shuffled around freely anytime)


## What's next:
- Connect CMS to actual repository with rest of the website
- Setup CI/CD on GitLab
- Build other subpages
- Migrate content
