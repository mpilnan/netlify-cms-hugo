LAS VEGAS, Nevada, May 18, 2021 –[Tachyum](http://www.tachyum.com)™ was invited to present at the China (Shaanxi) – Slovakia Economic and Trade Cooperation and Cultural Tourism Exchange Conference during the Fifth Silk Road International Expo in Xi’an, Shaanxi Province on May 11 – 15. Dr. Rado Danilak, co-founder and CEO of Tachyum spoke about how the Prodigy Universal Processor for servers, AI and HPC enables data centers to exceed the capacity of the human brain while drastically lowering power consumption and costs, and how it represents opportunities for collaborative partnerships.

The Conference was organized by the Embassy of the Slovak Republic in Beijing and Shaanxi Provincial Department of Commerce with the support of Shaanxi Provincial People’s Government of China and Projects of Economic Diplomacy of Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs of the Slovak Republic (MFEA).

The purpose of this B2B and B2G event was to deepen the investment cooperation and exchanges between Slovakia and China (Shaanxi), promote enterprise partnerships and build a cooperative platform.

Ingrid Brockova, State Secretary of the MFEA, presented the significant potential of Slovakia, where IT innovations play a big role. Tachyum has headquartered its R&D center in Slovakia and is one of the founding members of I4DI (Innovations for Digital Infrastructure), which together with Ministry of Investment, Regional Development and Informatization and Slovak Academy of Sciences established the National Supercomputer Centre (NSCC) aimed at developing the world’s fastest AI supercomputer based on the company’s technology. Prodigy is the world’s first Universal Processor that integrates CPU, GPU and TPU capabilities into a single homogeneous architecture to deliver industry-leading performance for data center, AI and HPC workloads.

“China represents a very important market and we are pleased to have the opportunity to speak to more than 150 attendees, governmental institutions, chambers of commerce and leading engineering and hi-tech companies,” said Dr. Radoslav Danilak, co-founder and CEO of Tachyum.

Tachyum's Prodigy can run HPC applications, convolutional AI, explainable AI, general AI, bio AI, and spiking neural networks, plus normal data center workloads, on a single homogeneous processor platform, using existing and standard programming models. Without Prodigy, data center customers must use a combination of CPUs, GPUs, TPUs and other accelerators for these different workloads, creating inefficiency, expense, and the complexity of maintaining separate hardware infrastructures. Using specific hardware dedicated to each type of workload (e.g. data center, AI, HPC), results in the significant underutilization of hardware resources, and more challenging programming, support, and maintenance environments. Prodigy’s ability to seamlessly switch among these various workloads dramatically changes the competitive landscape and drastically improves data center economics.

##### About Tachyum

Tachyum is disrupting data center, HPC, and AI markets by providing the world’s first Universal Processor, with industry leading performance, cost and power, across all three computational domains, while, at the same time, enabling data centers to exceed the capacity of the human brain. Tachyum, Co-founded by Dr. Radoslav Danilak, and its flagship product Prodigy, begins high-rate production in 2021, with software emulations and an FPGA-based emulator available to early adopters. It is targeting a $50B market, growing at 20% per year. With data centers currently consuming over 3% of the planet’s electricity, predicted to be 10% by 2025, the ultra-low power Prodigy Universal Processor is critical, if we want to continue doubling worldwide data center capacity every 4 years. Tachyum is one of the founding members of I4DI (Innovations for Digital Infrastructure), which will build the world’s fastest AI supercomputer in Slovakia showcasing Prodigy.  Tachyum has offices in the USA and Slovakia, EU.
