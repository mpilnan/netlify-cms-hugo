Idle Prodigy-powered universal servers in hyperscale data centers, during off-peak hours, will deliver 10x more AI Neural Network training/inference resources than currently available, CAPEX free (i.e. at low cost, since the Prodigy-powered universal computing servers are already bought & paid for).

As AI migrates to more sophisticated and control-intensive disciplines, such as Spiking Neural Nets, Explainable AI, Symbolic AI and Bio AI, Prodigy will deliver an order of magnitude better performance than its competitors.

Tachyumâ€™s Prodigy based TPU core will be sold as a licensable soft IP core, enabling edge computing and IOT products to directly incorporate high performance AI capabilities at a very low cost. IOT products will have onboard high-performance AI inference, optimized to exploit Prodigy-based AI training from either the cloud or the home office.
