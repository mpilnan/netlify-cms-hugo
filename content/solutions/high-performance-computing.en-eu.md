Prodigy’s breakthrough computational density (MIPS/Socket, MIPS/Watt) and its unprecedented I/O bandwidth, coupled with its universality, will increase Petascale and Exascale HPC access dramatically, across a broad spectrum of use cases, while driving HPC costs down appreciably. The societal effects of cost-efficient Exascale computing resources, available for rent at hyperscale data centers everywhere, will be profound.

Dedicated Prodigy-powered HPC systems will be affordable at the Enterprise level. Prodigy will “democratize” HPC, by bringing its capabilities to small and medium enterprises, at a much lower CAPEX and OPEX than what is currently available today.

For dedicated, state-of-the-art government-funded Exascale systems, the Prodigy processor released in 2021 directly enables a direct path to 50-100 ExaFLOPS machines by 2023, at 3-6x lower cost per ExaFLOPS versus the announced budget for the latest El Capitan 2 EF system, also due out in 2023.
