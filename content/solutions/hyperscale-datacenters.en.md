Tachyum’s Prodigy processor will enable hyperscale data centers, its primary market, to become low cost, energy efficient universal computing centers. Hyperscale data centers with the Prodigy universal processors will reduce their TCO (Total Cost of Operations) by a factor of 4x – saving each hyperscale customer billions of dollars per year.

Prodigy’s industry-leading performance, across data centers, AI, and High-Performance Computing (HPC) workloads, is a game-changer. Idle Prodigy-powered “universal servers” can be seamlessly powered up and reconfigured as ad hoc AI networks that can deliver 10x more AI resources than the current baseline. Alternatively, these same idle universal servers can just as easily be powered up and configured as HPC systems that will deliver ExaFLOPS (a billion, billion floating point operations per second) level performance. Prodigy delivers all of this at 10x lower power and 3x lower cost, with a compete software stack for out of the box operation, including common data center applications ported to Prodigy native ISA (Instruction Set Architecture) and a dynamic binary emulator that enables legacy x86 applications to run at Xeon speed.
